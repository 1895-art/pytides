pytides
=======


####Installation

```easy_install pytides```

or

```pip install pytides```

should do the trick.

####Usage
Pytides is in its infancy, and hasn't yet been properly documented. The best way to get started would be to read [this example](https://github.com/sam-cox/pytides/wiki/Example-Pytides-Usage).

####Contribution
I would welcome any help with Pytides. Particularly if you have knowledge of constituent data (including node factors) which other institutions/packages use. I can be reached at sam.cox@cantab.net or via github.

Please note however that Pytide's lack of attempts to infer constituents, or exclude similar constituents based on their synodic periods is an intentional design decision.
